/**
 * @file hal_pwm.h
 * @brief Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) interface for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).
 *
 * @details
 * This header file provides the interface for including the appropriate
 * PWM driver implementation based on the target architecture.
 * For Cortex-M4 targets, it includes the `core/cortex-m4/pwm.h` header.
 *
 * The HAL PWM module offers a platform-independent way to configure and
 * control PWM signals for tasks such as motor control, signal generation,
 * and brightness control.
