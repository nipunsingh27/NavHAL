\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Architecture-\/agnostic GPIO HAL entry point for Nav\+HAL. 

This file includes the appropriate architecture-\/specific GPIO HAL implementation based on the target MCU defined at compile time (e.\+g., CORTEX\+\_\+\+M4).

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
This file should be included by user applications via {\ttfamily \doxylink{navhal_8h}{navhal.\+h}}. Direct inclusion is not recommended unless you are customizing the HAL.
