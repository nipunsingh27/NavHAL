\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) interface for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). 

This header file provides the interface for including the appropriate PWM driver implementation based on the target architecture. For Cortex-\/\+M4 targets, it includes the {\ttfamily \doxylink{pwm_8h}{core/cortex-\/m4/pwm.\+h}} header.

The HAL PWM module offers a platform-\/independent way to configure and control PWM signals for tasks such as motor control, signal generation, and brightness control.
