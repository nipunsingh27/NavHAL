\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Root header file for the Nav\+HAL project by Nav\+Robotec. 

Nav\+HAL is the official hardware abstraction layer (HAL) developed by Nav\+Robotec. It provides a clean, modular, and extensible C interface to abstract peripheral control (such as GPIO, UART, timers) across multiple microcontroller architectures.

Include this file in your application to access the full HAL API.
