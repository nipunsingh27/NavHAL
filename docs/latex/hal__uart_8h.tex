\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) interface for UART communication. 

This header file provides the interface for including the appropriate UART driver implementation based on the target architecture. For Cortex-\/\+M4 targets, it includes the {\ttfamily \doxylink{uart_8h}{core/cortex-\/m4/uart.\+h}} header.

The HAL UART module allows platform-\/independent serial communication via USART peripherals, supporting functions like transmission and reception of characters and strings.
