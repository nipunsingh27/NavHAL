\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) interface for clock management. 

This header file provides the interface for including the appropriate clock driver implementation based on the target architecture. For Cortex-\/\+M4 targets, it includes the {\ttfamily \doxylink{clock_8h}{core/cortex-\/m4/clock.\+h}} header.

The HAL clock module provides an abstraction over the hardware-\/specific clock control mechanisms, enabling platform-\/independent code to manage system and peripheral clocks.
