\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) interface for I2C communication. 

This header file provides the interface for including the appropriate I2C driver implementation based on the target architecture. For Cortex-\/\+M4 targets, it includes the {\ttfamily \doxylink{i2c_8h}{core/cortex-\/m4/i2c.\+h}} header.

The HAL layer allows higher-\/level code to remain platform-\/independent by abstracting hardware-\/specific implementations.
