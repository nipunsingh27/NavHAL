\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) interface for timer peripherals. 

This header file provides the interface for including the appropriate timer driver implementation based on the target architecture. For Cortex-\/\+M4 targets, it includes the {\ttfamily \doxylink{timer_8h}{core/cortex-\/m4/timer.\+h}} header.

The HAL timer module allows platform-\/independent configuration and control of hardware timers for tasks such as delays, periodic interrupts, and event scheduling.
